## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (version 18 or above recommended)
*   npm or yarn package managers

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-folder>
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Configure your environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  Configure your Firebase credentials inside the `firebase-applet-config.json` configuration file at the root of the project workspace.

### Running in Development

Run the localized dev server on port `3000`:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build & Deployment

To bundle both client assets and server scripts into production-ready standalone packages:
```bash
npm run build
```

This generates:
*   `/dist/` containing pre-built, optimized, static SPA files.
*   `/dist/server.cjs` which bundles your backend Express handler into a self-contained CommonJS target to bypass ES Modules resolver constraints during deployment.

Start your deployed instance with:
```bash
npm run start
```
